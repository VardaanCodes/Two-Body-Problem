    "Simulate the orbital interaction between two bodies under Newtonian gravity. The simulation should be **interactive**, **visual**, and **numerically accurate**.\n",

    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants must build a 2D simulation that allows users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set initial **positions, velocities, and masses** for two bodies\n",
    "- Visualize dynamic **orbital paths**\n",
    "- Interact with the system in real-time (modify parameters, pause/reset)\n",
    "- Optionally include: collision detection, escape conditions, or a center-of-mass reference frame\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí¨ Modeling & Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants must model gravitational interactions and implement a numerical solver (e.g., **Verlet, Runge-Kutta**, or similar) to update the system state over time. Precision and stability are key.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **No physics equations are given** ‚Äî teams are expected to derive and implement appropriate force models and solvers.\n",

    "## üìä Simulation Requirements\n",

    "- Real-time visualization of body positions and orbit trails\n",
    "- Parameter controls: mass, position, velocity\n",
    "- Smooth animations and user feedback\n",
    "- Optional enhancements: elastic collisions, escape paths, center-of-mass tracking\n",
